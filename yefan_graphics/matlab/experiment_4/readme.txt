Square trajectory with period of 10 seconds.
Logs are Cartesian coordinates of EE + State vector

Log file name are in format: 
"QP_log_U_A.txt"
where U - cost_u, A - cost_a (dot between integer part and fractional part is ommited)
For example: 
QP_log_01_100.txt       means   cost_u = 0.1,   cost_a = 100
QP_log_005_1000.txt     means   cost_u = 0.05,  cost_a = 1000
